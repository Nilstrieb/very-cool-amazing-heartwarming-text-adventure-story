    message: |
      You enter the corridor right behind the door. It looks longer than it probably is, but you are unable

              Another step into what you hope is the right direction. You've lost every sense of orientation.
              The floor feels slippy, and everything feels wet. You continue walking into the same direction.
              After some walking, the echo of your steps changes. It feels bigger, and emptier. You look around,
              but you can't see anything.

              You go forwards, and it's getting darker with every step. For every footstep, there is a loud echo.
              You feel alone, but also sense the presence of something. It feels like it's always there and watching you.
              But you don't see anything but the pure darkness. The hole in the door has somehow disappeared.

  sacrifice-hall:
    message: |
      Suddenly everything gets bright. You realize that you're in a new room. It's huge, over 50 meters high and probably
      with a diameter of 200 meters. You must have gone very far into the mountain, everything feels so huge. 
      The room looks rather empty, and has a rounded shape towards the top. There is some strange looking device 
      hanging from the top towards the center, exactly where you are standing right now. You panic and look around. 
      There are strange blue ghosts flying through the hall, hundreds of them.
    verbs:

        ghosts:
          They are flying!
